This is an example of AJAX & JSON.
JSON(Javascript Object Notation) is an agreed upon format for sending and recieving data.(arrays and objects nested inside each other)
AJAX is a way for sending and recieving data on the fly without the page reload.
AJAX is used to load JSON data from another source like dynamic pages on the server.
